A while ago the Backend team at Close started to introduce Kafka for features
built on top of [Event Log](https://developer.close.com/#event-log). We know
it's a good fit for us and will provide ample opportunity to use the event
stream with confidence.

## Data migration process

Things appeared to work alright for a while, but recently we needed to perform a
data migration that required emitting a large amount of events. The migration
process was written in the most simple way, since this type of code is run once,
and thrown away when complete. One of the decisions made for simplicity was to
run it as a single thread in a single process at first. This way we can easily
work out bottlenecks by profiling how it runs. While profiling an initial test
run, I noticed a non-trivial portion of the run time was taken by a `flush()`
call of the Kafka producer. I mentioned this to my peers but we concluded that
this is expected - and necessary since every event has to be delivered before we
move on, to maintain maximum consistency.

## Threading

In most migrations we had before, scaling out was not necessary, we could just
run it in background for a while with minimal impact. Not this time though. The
volume of data that needed processing was so large that running it in one thread
would take multiple months, so we needed to scale out. Performance metrics I've
collected during initial runs indicated that impact will be minimal even if we
run 10 migration processes. So in the next iteration the migration process was
changed to run in multiple parallel threads in the same process. At Close, the
main threading framework we use in Python is `gevent`. It's a green threading
library that hooks into IO routines and schedules other green threads -
greenlets - inside the same OS thread to run whenever currently running thread
needs to wait on an IO operation to be complete.

However the parallelized migration wasn't doing as well as one would expect.
Even on 7 parallel threads, the overall throughput improved by only 20-30%, very
far from expected 7x increase. What's worse, increasing thread count further
didn't improve anything - but there weren't any obvious bottlenecks. CPU usage
was well below 100% on that thread, network IO had a lot of headroom, and
databases didn't mind the load. The threads were completely independent and had
nothing to share except the Python interpreter which wasn't that busy.

To move the project forward, I switched the migration to multi-process
architecture, where separate Python OS processes (each with only single thread)
worked on the data independently. This time we got the expected throughput
increase proportionally to the number of processes.

## C extension

The multi-threaded performance issue was still on my mind though. I was thinking
about kinds of inter-thread communication that could prevent ready threads from
progressing while other threads were waiting on IO. I double-checked database IO
but it was correctly handled by `gevent` - and we were using it this way for a
long time, including in our `gevent`-based `gunicorn` web servers. And then the
little detail about Kafka `flush()` call from earlier profiling results came to
mind. I realized that, in contrast with other IO calls, the call stack just
ended on the `flush` call from the kafka library, not on a builtin socket IO
routine. Turns out, Kafka client is a C extension and it does IO from the C
code, not Python. That means it blocks the entire OS thread until Kafka servers
respond, and other greenlets cannot be scheduled during that wait.
[It's a known issue with the official Kafka client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/issues/612).

## Solutions

What do we do about it? We went through a couple options:

- Switch to a different, pure-Python library. This introduces additional
  unknowns and would require additional testing to make sure it matches our
  performance, functionality, and reliability requirements for a critical
  infrastructure component.
- Patch the C extension to let `gevent` loop to run. This is a cumbersome option
  that also introduces risk of bugs in a multi-threaded environment. We also
  didn't know if the library could support multiple concurrent calls from the
  same thread.

The final path we chose depends on the fact that `flush` call is nothing more
than a loop that calls `poll()` to handle responses from the server. So we
implemented our own pure-Python `flush`. Instead of sleeping in C, we give
control to `gevent` loop from Python code by simply calling `gevent.sleep()`
after calling `poll(0)`.

```python
def flush(producer):
    while len(producer):
        producer.poll(0)
        gevent.sleep(0.001)
```

With the improved `gevent`-friendly `flush` implementation, I was able to
saturate CPU with multiple threads in the migration process. This change also
made a slight improvement for `gevent`-based web request processing. Now HTTP
requests that are currently waiting on event delivery confirmation won't delay
other requests served by the same process.

## Closing thoughts

One should always be aware of blocking calls when working with asynchronous
code. There are abstractions like `gevent` or `asyncio`, that let you treat
async code as if it was synchronous, but keep in mind that these abstractions
tend to leak sometimes. In case of Python specifically, note which of your
dependencies are C extensions, as those can be blocking the main interpreter
loop.
