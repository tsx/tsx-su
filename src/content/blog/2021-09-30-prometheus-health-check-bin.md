## The blocking process

One of the recent issues we had in production was a process that appeared to
just randomly stop doing what it's supposed to do. These kind of problems are
often hard to debug interactively, since it happens rare enough so you can't
just catch it before it happens, and next to impossible to reproduce in an
isolated environment.

While the team is busy trying to determine the root cause, we need to keep the
system running despite the occasional hold-ups. At Close, being a lean team, we
build extensive automated alerting to make our lives easier. But how can you
detect automatically that a process has stopped doing its primary function?

At first, when we were just learning about the issue, the alerts were only about
a consequence - the queue of the items that need processing was growing beyond a
set threshold. The main downside of this type of alert is that queue size
fluctuates during the day and sometimes has short spikes due to customer
actions, which is a perfectly normal situation. But that means we can't make the
alert too sensitive (very low threshold or reacting to short spikes) as we would
get a lot of false positives, and an insensitive or slow alert means we take a
corrective action of restarting the stuck process too late - and customers do
notice the delays sometimes.

We also would not want to rely on the process to self-report any issues. If it's
blocked by something, there's a good chance that an attempt to self-report from
within would also be blocked.

## Reporting regular progress

The main indication of a process being stuck is actually _absence_ of normal
work instead of some active action. We changed the process to report a timestamp
of when it last processed an item. This way, we can detect a stuck process much
earlier - by last reported timestamp staying the same as real time goes forward.

Here's how such a metric looks like in prometheus client output.

```
# HELP closeio_last_iteration_ts Time of last processing iteration
# TYPE closeio_last_iteration_ts gauge
closeio_last_iteration_ts 1633021679.8027766
```

This is a huge improvement as we can precisely tell the difference between
queues' size growing due to customer action versus not processing the items from
the queue. However, if the issue occurs, it still requires someone on the team
to take a manual action to restore the system to a completely working state. The
issue is not very frequent and we already had prepared steps to follow, but it
still can be annoying when it happens and you get paged outside of your working
hours.

Now it's time to make the system self-heal.

## Health checks

Most of the compute workloads we run at Close are orchestrated with Kubernetes.
It's useful not only for deploying our app multiple times a day as we ship new
features and improve internals, but also adds a lot of resiliency when operating
in a cloud-based environment. It can restart a process or a container when it
exits abnormally or appears non-functional.

In our case, the process did look somewhat functional since it responded to a
basic health check and was able to report current metric values, despite not
doing any useful work. The next task is to actually utilize the metrics to
recognize that a specific stale timestamp metric means that process is not
healthy anymore and we need it restarted.

As part of the existing health check, we already had a simple shell script that
used an existing metric. Here it is in its entirety:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$1/metrics/ | grep 'cio_service_state 1.0'
```

All it does is query the metrics endpoint via http and grep for a predefined
string. It works fine for the most part, but it's not as easy to extend this to
check _freshness_ of some different metric. To do that in a shell script, you'd
hold onto the metrics output, grep it multiple times and do arithmetic on
timestamps. With shell scripts, any kind of logic or control flow beyond simple
linear command chains becomes hard to maintain, and correctly dealing with all
the ways things could go wrong is even harder.

As our product's backend is built in Python, the next best option was writing up
a quick python script. The implementation would be simple thanks to a lot of
awesome libraries available. But when we tried to deploy a replacement, we
discovered that the health check itself became a bottleneck of the entire
system. Starting up Python interpreter and loading a lot of library code takes a
significant amount of time - and we need to do it over and over again, very
frequently for thousands of processes. The runtime of a single health check call
went from ~30ms real time to ~100ms, and CPU usage also increased significantly.
That version had to be reverted.

## Can we do better?

We try to keep the amount of different tools as little as reasonably possible
and are very careful about introducing a new technology. But in cases where a
new tool can be reasonably separate from the rest of the system during initial
deployment, we're not afraid to use something less standard, as long as it
brings significant benefits. One of the older, existing examples is
[ciso8601](https://pypi.org/project/ciso8601/) - a C-based library that parses
ISO 8601-formatted datetimes, which we use _a lot_.

In this case, having a pre-compiled, native binary that can perform a health
check quickly without a significant overhead would be very desirable, and we
don't have to change anything else.

In 2021, there are quite a few options for developing native binary programs
that offer significantly better developer ergonomics and less footguns than C.
For this project we chose Rust. It provides somewhat automatic and safe memory
management (which is useful for dealing with variable output from metrics
endpoints) while not having non-determinism typical to GC-based runtimes.

## Health check binary

We've developed
[Prometheus Health Checker](https://github.com/closeio/prometheus-health-checker/) -
a simple and very focused tool that does just what we need - fetching and
evaluating metrics, and nothing more. Rust has a great ecosystem, and we've used
`nom` for parsing metrics data, `ureq` for a simple blocking http client as well
as `clap` for a command line interface.

The resulting binary program starts up and runs significantly faster than the
simple bash `curl | grep` script we've started with. The run time of a single
check went from ~30ms to ~10ms, dominated mostly by the response time of the
metrics endpoint. That's a great 3x improvement - on top of having the extra
feature of checking a freshness metric. Deployment went great and without
issues. We're running it hundreds of times per second right now at Close.

Of course, there are downsides to this approach too. Even though Rust is gaining
popularity, not everyone on our team knows it. Getting started with Rust can
also be a challenge when your background is mostly imperative style programming
in dynamic language. A strict, static type system, functional programming
idioms, as well as borrow checker - all can be significant obstacles before
being productive in a new language.

That said, the approach we took makes it a worthwhile tradeoff. The tool is
mostly complete and using it from the operations perspective doesn't require
knowing the language itself, so we don't have to train the entire team to get
better health checks.

## Conclusion

We've successfully tried a new technology and deployed it in production, got
significant benefits from it with very little risk.
