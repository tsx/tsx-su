## Shireframe

*Shireframe* allows you to create wireframes by writing HTML using your favorite IDE, preview results in your favorite browser, branch/diff/merge wireframes as code in your favorite VCS and do anything else you usually do with source code.

**I developed this tool to create wireframes faster and iterate on product techincal design faster.**

The code for this project is [available at GitHub](https://github.com/tsx/shireframe) under GNU GPLv2 license.
